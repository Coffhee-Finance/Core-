Coffhee is an encrypted decentralized exchange for trading encrypted, shielded, and confidential tokens. The core of this protocol are the encrypted tokens and LayerZero general message passing contracts.

The token cUSD.e (Confidential USD.e) is a wrapped ERC20 version of USD.e that encrypts token balances for added privacy.

The flow of the projects works like this:

1) USD.e is locked inside a contract on BNB Chain (LayerZero Adapter)
2) The OFT Adapter then calls for the minting of the cUSD.e on Fhenix (receiving chain)
3) Goldsky is used to bring in price feeds to the DEX.
